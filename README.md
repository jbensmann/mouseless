# mouseless

This program is a replacement for the physical mouse in Linux.

It is the successor of [xmouseless](https://github.com/jbensmann/xmouseless).

## Features

- move the pointer continuously
- change the pointer speed on the fly
- click, grab, scroll
- remap keys

## Why

There are various reasons why one would want to control the mouse pointer with the keyboard instead of a regular mouse:

- keep your hands on the keyboard
- laptop with no or a poor touchpad
- no mouse at hand
- cannot use a mouse for some reason
- precise control
- for fun

Of course, it would be best to avoid using the mouse pointer at all, e.g. with the use of tiling window managers and
application shortcuts, but sometimes there is no way around.

## Installation

The simplest way is to download a binary from [Releases](https://github.com/jbensmann/mouseless/releases).

Or you can build it from source (requires that go is installed):

```shell
go build -ldflags="-s -w" .
```

When successful, a binary with name `mouseless` will pop out.

## Usage

First you need to create a config file, e.g. `~/.config/mouseless/config.yaml`, see below for an example. In there, you
have to specify the keyboard device that mouseless should read from, you can e.g. use these commands to find possible
candidates:

```shell
ls /dev/input/by-id/*kbd*
ls /dev/input/by-path/*kbd*
```

After that, you can run mouseless like this:

```shell
sudo mouseless --config ~/.config/mouseless/config.yaml
```

For troubleshooting, you can use the --debug flag to show more verbose log messages.

## Configuration

The format of the configuration file is YAML, you do not have to know what exactly that is, just take care
that the indentation level of the lines is correct. Lines starting with a `#` are comments.
Here is a small example that illustrates the most features:

```yaml
devices:
# change this to a keyboard device
- "/dev/input/by-id/SOME_KEYBOARD_REPLACE_ME-event-kbd"
# this is executed when mouseless starts
# startCommand: ""
# the default speed for mouse movement
baseMouseSpeed: 750.0
# speed of the mouse when it starts moving
startMouseSpeed: 75.0
# The shape of the mouse's acceleration curve
mouseAccelerationCurve: 2.0
# how many milliseconds for the mouse to accelerate up to baseMouseSpeed; 0 to reach top speed immediately
mouseAccelerationTime: 100.0
# The shape of the mouse's deceleration curve
mouseDecelerationCurve: 3.0
# How long it takes for the mouse to slow down and stop from baseMouseSpeed
mouseDecelerationTime: 300.0
# the default speed for scrolling
baseScrollSpeed: 20.0
layers:
# the first layer is active at start
- name: initial
  bindings:
    # when tab is held and another key pressed, activate mouse layer
    tab: tap-hold-next tab ; toggle-layer mouse ; 500
    # when a is held for 300ms, activate mouse layer
    a: tap-hold a ; toggle-layer mouse ; 300
    # right alt key toggles arrows layer
    rightalt: toggle-layer arrows
    # switch escape with capslock
    esc: capslock
    capslock: esc
# a layer for mouse movement
- name: mouse
  # when true, keys that are not mapped keep their original meaning
  passThrough: true
  bindings:
    # quit mouse layer
    q: layer initial
    # keep the mouse layer active
    space: layer mouse
    r: reload-config
    l: move  1  0
    j: move -1  0
    k: move  0  1
    i: move  0 -1
    p: scroll up
    n: scroll down
    leftalt: speed 4.0
    e: speed 0.3
    capslock: speed 0.1
    f: button left
    d: button middle
    s: button right
    # move to the top left corner
    k0: "exec xdotool mousemove 0 0"
# another layer for arrows and some other keys
- name: arrows
  passThrough: true
  bindings:
    e: up
    s: left
    d: down
    f: right
    q: esc
    w: backspace
    r: delete
    v: enter
```

One can define an arbitrary number of layers, each with an arbitrary number of bindings, e.g. `esc: capslock`
which maps the escape key to capslock. If you do not know the name of a key, you can start mouseless with the
--debug flag, press the key and look for an output like `Pressed:  rightalt (100)`, which tells you that the name of the
key is `rightalt`. Alternatively you can also use the keycode in the parentheses, which is 100 in this case. Note that
the name of a key does not necessarily match what is printed on your keyboard, e.g. with a German layout where the `y`
and `z` keys are swapped in comparison to the English layout, but the name of the `z` key is `y` and vice versa.

One can also map a key to multiple ones like `a: leftshift+k1` which results in `!`, at least for an English or German
layout.

Aside from remapping keys, there are a bunch of other actions available, e.g. `rightalt: toggle-layer arrows`, which
jumps to the arrows layer when rightalt is pressed and jumps back on release. These are all available actions:

| action                 | examples                                  | meaning                                                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<key-combo>`          | `a`, `comma`, `shift+a`                   | maps to the key (combo)                                                   |
| `layer <layer>`        | `layer mouse`                             | switches to the layer with the given name                                 |
| `toggle-layer <layer>` | `toggle-layer mouse`                      | switches to the layer with the given name while the mapped key is pressed |
| `move <x> <y>`         | `move 1 0`                                | moves the pointer into the given direction                                |
| `scroll <direction>`   | `scroll up`                               | scrolls up or down                                                        |
| `speed <multiplier>`   | `speed 2.5`                               | multiplies the pointer and scroll speeds with the given value             |
| `button <button>`      | `button left`                             | presses a mouse button (left, right or middle)                            |
| `exec <cmd>`           | `exec notify-send "hello from mouseless"` | executes the given command (the example sends a desktop notification)     |
| `reload-config`        | `reload-config`                           | reloads the configuration file                                            |

With these actions one could e.g. toggle the mouse layer with `tab: toggle-layer mouse`, so that all bindings from the
mouse layer are available while `tab` is held down. However, this sacrifices the `tab` key which might not be desirable.
For these cases there are some "meta actions" which allow to put multiple actions on a single key and which are inspired
by KMonad. The arguments of those actions have to be separated with `;`.

| meta action                                                    | example                                            | meaning                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tap-hold <tap action>; <hold action>; <timeout>`              | `tap-hold a; toggle-layer mouse; 300`              | when the mapped key is pressed and released within 300ms, presses a, otherwise toggles the mouse layer                        |
| `tap-hold-next <tap action>; <hold action>; <timeout>`         | `tap-hold-next a; toggle-layer mouse; 300`         | same as tap-hold, with the addition that the tap action is executed when another key is pressed while `a` is still held down  |
| `tap-hold-next-release <tap action>; <hold action>; <timeout>` | `tap-hold-next-release a; toggle-layer mouse; 300` | same as tap-hold, with the addition that the tap action is executed when another key is released while `a` is still held down |
| `multi <action1>; <action2>`                                   | `multi a; toggle-layer mouse`                      | executes both actions                                                                                                         |

## Run without root privileges

To run without using sudo, you can add an udev rule with the following command, which allows your user to read from
keyboard devices and create a virtual keyboard and mouse:

```sh
echo "KERNEL==\"uinput\", GROUP=\"$USER\", MODE:=\"0660\"
KERNEL==\"event*\", GROUP=\"$USER\", NAME=\"input/%k\", MODE=\"660\"" \
| sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-$USER.rules
```

To apply the changes, you can simply reboot your machine.
